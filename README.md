API challenge code
I enjoyed doing the code2040 challenges. They were all very fun. It was nice to work with the API although at
the beginning a bit frustrating, but overall I learned something new and am grateful for that. I was awesome to work 
with JSON objects, it was a good review for me since I had forgotten about them since last working with them in my 
internship. I completed the assignments in python since I was able to make use of their extensive libraries. :D
